    <p>Welcome!
    Thank you for taking the time to contribute to our questionnaire. By answering these questions for us, 
        you are contributing to a scientific study into the affective impact books hold for readers. These pages contain a brief explanation of the study. If you want to know more, or if you have questions about the way we handle your data, go to the <em>FAQ</em> or contact us at <a href="mailto:peter.boot@huygens.knaw.nl">peter.boot@huygens.knaw.nl</a> and/or <a href="mailto:marijn.koolen@di.huc.knaw.nl">marijn.koolen@di.huc.knaw.nl</a>. Peter and Marijn created this questionnaire together.

        We created this questionnaire because we'd like to know how readers are impacted by the fiction they read. For the purposes of this study, we distinguish between eight different types of affective impact. Computationally, we measure how online book reviews illustrate these different types of impact. 
    </p>
    <p> Our interest in this topic is purely scientific. The data we collect is used for research purposes only and no money is being made in the process.
    </p>
    <p>In order to take part in the questionnaire, we ask you to read the information about the types of impact on the next page. After that, you can go to the <em>questionnaire</em> or, if you prefer, look at some examples or our <em>FAQ</em> first.
