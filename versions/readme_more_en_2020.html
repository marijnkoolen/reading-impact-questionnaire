    <p> <b>What is this study about?</b>
        <br>
    We are studying the (affective) impact that reading fiction has on readers. We are not the first to study this topic. What’s new about our study is our primary source of data: online book reviews, and the fact that we are using computational methods to analyze these reviews. We are studying a large set of reviews published by readers on websites like Goodreads and Amazon.</p>

    <p>Previous researchers have often speculated on the affective impact fiction has on readers. Other, more empirically-minded researchers have studied the affective impact of reading through experiments. They ask readers, often university students, to read a specific story and then have them fill out a questionnaire. This is a good way to set up an experiment because every reader reads the same story and you can ask them whatever you want to know.</p>

    <p>However, in experiments like this the readers do not get to choose their reading material themselves, and they often read in unnatural settings such as a university building. By contrast, online reviews are written by people who have read whatever they chose to read in whatever place they chose, without any observers or time pressure. Additionally, the group of readers leaving reviews online is large and varied in terms of demographic properties. That is why we think online reviews are a great dataset for research.</p>

   <p> <b>Where do your eight categories of affective impact come from? </b>
        <br>
    We have selected our eight categories of affective impact, in part, because they connect to research that has previously been done into the affective impact of reading. Some research has claimed that the affective impact of reading makes readers more sociable. Empathy for fictional characters and reflection on fictional events may help you empathize and reflect in real life.</p>

      <p> <b>Can you tell me more about the definitions of the different types of impact? </b>
        <br> 
    Sure! Throughout this questionnaire we have tried to explain our eight impact-categories in different ways: through abstract descriptions as well as concrete examples. The definitions below have structured the explanations and examples you have read.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Attention: the reader's feeling of concentration or focus on his or her reading (Kuijpers 2014).</li>
 
    <li>Positive feeling: any positive, fleeting or permanent, strong or weak, emotional response during or after reading, be it targeted at the book as a whole, its author, its characters, its style, aspects of the world that it describes, or any other aspects. A feeling is positive if it contributes to a positive reading experience; in that sense, sad or awful events can contribute to a positive response to the book.</li>
     <ul>
 
        <li>Narrative feeling: a subcategory of positive feeling. Any feeling (contributing to a positive reading experience) with respect to the narrative world and the characters; this includes both being drawn into the narrative world (absorption or transportation) and character-directed emotions such as sympathy and identification (Koopman and Hakemulder 2015, p. 90);</li>
       
        <li>Stylistic feeling: a subcategory of positive feeling. Any feeling (contributing to a positive reading experience) such as admiration, appreciation and defamiliarization, targeted at the aesthetic features of the text (such as such as its tone, choice of words, use of metaphor or the way the sentences flow) (Koopman and Hakemulder 2015, p. 94);</li>
 
        <li>Humor: a subcategory of positive feeling. An emotional response of laughter, smiling or amusement; the effect of any type of humor in the text.</li>
        </ul>
 
    <li>Surprise: a feeling of surprise as a response to any aspect of the book, such as its characters, its style, or the world that it describes.</li>
 
    <li>Negative feeling: feelings of dislike or disapproval towards any element of the book, such as a dislike for a storyline or character or a feeling of boredom or frustration with the book as a whole. A feeling counts as negative if it contributes to a negative reading experience: events that are in themselves awful, such as torture, can be positively appreciated, for example in a thriller.</li>
 
    <li>Reflection: thoughts, insights and musings on oneself, others, society or the book.</li></ul>

    <p><b>So what is the use of my responses?</b>
        <br>
    Because there are so many book reviews available on websites like Amazon and Goodreads, we are analyzing these reviews computationally. In order to make sense of all these texts, we look at specific words or phrases. A word like “beautiful” probably refers to stylistic feeling, while “engaging” is probably about attention. The word “amazing” probably refers to a more general positive affective response. Sometimes we need specific combinations of words to determine the kind of impact a review describes. We have created hundreds of rules to measure the different types of impact based on the use of specific words. Many of those words were taken from existing research.</p>

    <p>The computer can simply apply those rules. That gives us results indicating how often a specific affective response occurs in reviews and how often it occurs in reviews of specific books or genres. But we can’t assume that these results are correct, because we are not sure the rules we generated to measure affective impact all work. Maybe we categorized “weird” as a word indicating reflection, when it turns out people often mean “weird” in a more general, positive sense. Maybe we thought “beautiful” was an indicator of stylistic feeling, when people mostly use it to describe storylines, which would fall into the category of narrative feeling. So we need to test out whether the computer and the people who read and write online reviews agree on the kind of impact a specific word or phrase indicates.</p>

    <p>That is where you come in. In this survey, we have taken a limited number of sentences from the reviews for you to rate according to our impact-categories. Then we can compare whether the human assessments agree with the computational assessments. If they do, our computational model works, and we can continue analyzing reviews using the computer. If they don’t, we have to go back to the rules we wrote to measure affective impact and make some changes.</p>

    <p><b>Why did you give me a user-token?</b>
        <br>
    You are automatically assigned a user-token in case you want to answer some questions for us, come back later, then answer a few more. With your user-token, we can make sure we do not present you with the same sentences twice. We do not save any of your personal data for further use, except the optional questions about age, gender and reading habits that we ask you at the end of the survey.</p>

	<p><b>I liked doing this, can I answer more questions?</b>
	<br>
	Yes you can! Initially we show you ten sentences. But if you're willing to do more, you can always press the button that says 'Judge more sentences'. Another way of helping us is to ask your book-loving friends to fill out the questionnaire.</p>  
	
    <p><b>At the top of the questionnaire it says: “Enough assessments have been collected for [number of] sentences.” What does this mean?</b>
        <br>
    In order to get a clear sense of whether our computational model is working, we need three people to assess each of the sentences. The questionnaire only gives you ten sentences at a time, but you can keep assessing sentences for as long as you like. When a specific sentence has been judged by three different people, it has been assessed enough times and is added to the tally at the top of the questionnaire. It is a way for us to keep track of our progress.</p>

    <p><b>I have another question or I want to know more about this.</b>
