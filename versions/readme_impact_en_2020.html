        <p>
            In this study, we differentiate between eight types of (mostly affective) impact. 
            By “affect” we mean the same thing as “emotion” or “feeling.” 
        </p>
        <p>To illustrate what we mean by (affective) impact, we have selected some examples and described 
            the impact we think they express. Some sentences in the questionnaire may merely describe an 
            aspect of the book, while others go into the reader’s affective experience of reading. We ask 
            you to judge whether a specific sentence contains an element of impact or not. These judgements 
            are subjective and differences of opinion are possible. These differences of opinion are 
            important for us to distinguish between cases of very clear and more dubious impact.

            We are aware that these categories are difficult to define and can sometimes overlap. 
            The questions we will ask you do not have right or wrong answers. Instead, we ask you 
            to make subjective judgements, rating sentences from reviews on a five-point scale for 
            each type of impact. When selecting your answer, please consider how 
            strongly a sentence illustrates a specific type of impact and how sure you are of your 
            answer. If a sentence expresses impact very strongly or if you are very sure of your 
            judgement, go to the right on the five-point scale. If a sentence doesn't express impact 
            or if you are unsure, go to the left on the scale. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You are now ready to go <em>To the questionnaire</em>. Every sentence you judge is a great 
            help to us. If you still have questions, go to <em>Further information.</em>
