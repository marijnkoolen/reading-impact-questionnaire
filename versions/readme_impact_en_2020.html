        For the purposes of this study, we differentiate between eight types of affective impact. Please note that “affect” is taken here to mean the same thing as “emotion” or “feeling.” 
    </p>
 
            The types of impact are:
               <ul>
        <li>attention - the reader's feeling of concentration or focus on his or her reading (Kuijpers 2014).</li>

        <li>positive feeling: any positive emotional response to the book during or after reading. A feeling is positive if it contributes to a positive reading experience, so even sad or aweful events can contribute to a positive affective response.</li>
         <ul>
 
            <li>narrative feeling:  a subcategory of positive feeling, specifically response to the narrative properties of a book. This includes feelings about storylines, characters, scenes or elements of the storyworld.</li>

            <li>stylistic feeling: a subcategory of positive feeling, specifically response to the stylistic properties of a text such as feelings of admiration or defamiliarization at its tone, choice of words, use of metaphor or the way the sentences flow.</li>

            <li>humor: a subcategory of positive feeling. An emotional response of laughter, smiling or amusement; the effect of any type of humor in the text.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>surprise: a feeling of surprise at some element of the book, be it a plot development, part of the storyworld or a stylistic feature.</li>

        <li>negative feeling: feelings of dislike or disapproval towards any element of the book. This could mean an intense dislike for a storyline or character or a feeling of boredom or frustration with the book as a whole. Keep in mind that you may appreciate events that are in themselves afwul, such as torture, for example in thrillers. If the reviewer does so, the feeling does not count as negative. </li>

        <li>reflection: any response to a reading experience that has made the reader reflect on something from the book, such as a theme or topic, or on something from their own world.</li>
 
<p>We are aware that these categories are difficult to define and can sometimes overlap. The questions we will ask you do not have right or wrong answers. Instead, we ask you to make subjective judgements, rating sentences from reviews on a five-point scale for each type of impact. When selecting your answer, please take into consideration how strongly a sentence illustrates a specific type of impact and how sure you are of your answer. If a sentence expresses impact very strongly or if you are very sure of your judgement, go to the right on the five-point scale. If a sentence doesn't express impact or if you are unsure, go to the left on the scale.</p>
