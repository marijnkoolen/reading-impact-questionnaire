    <p>
        For the purposes of this study, we differentiate between eight types of affective impact. Please note that “affect” is taken here to mean the same thing as “emotion” or “feeling.” 
    </p>

    <p>To illustrate what we mean by affective impact, we have selected some examples and described the affective impact we think they express. Some of the sentences we present you with during the questionnaire may merely describe an aspect of the book, while others go into the reader’s affective experience of reading. We ask you to judge whether a specific sentence contains an element of affective response or not. Keep in mind that these judgements are subjective and differences of opinion are possible. These differences of opinion are important for us to distinguish between cases of very clear affective impact and more dubious impact.</p>
 
            The types of impact are:
               <ul>
        <li>attention - the reader's feeling of concentration or focus on his or her reading (Kuijpers 2014).</li>
        </div>
    <div className="readme readme-example">
        <div className="sentence">
            <label>Example Sentence Attention</label>
            <span className="sentence-text">
                "I read this book in one go, staying up until late at night just so I could finish it. ."
            </span>
        </div>
        <div className="readme readme-explanation">
            This sentence indicates attention because the reader’s focus on the book lasted for a long time.
        </div>    
        <li>positive feeling: any positive emotional response to the book during or after reading. A feeling is positive if it contributes to a positive reading experience, so even sad or aweful events can contribute to a positive affective response.</li>

            </span>
        </div>
        <div className="readme readme-explanation">
           This sentence indicates positive affective response because it uses a positive word, <i>“enjoyed,”</i> to describe the book overall.

         <ul>
            <li>narrative feeling:  a subcategory of positive feeling, specifically response to the narrative properties of a book. This includes feelings about storylines, characters, scenes or elements of the storyworld.</li>

        <div className="readme readme-explanation">
                This sentence indicates narrative feeling, because the reviewer describes an affective response <i>“enjoyed”</i>, to parts of the narrative: <i>“characters”</i> and <i>“the history of Guernsey.”</i>
        </div>
            <li>stylistic feeling: a subcategory of positive feeling, specifically response to the stylistic properties of a text such as feelings of admiration or defamiliarization at its tone, choice of words, use of metaphor or the way the sentences flow.</li>

            This sentence indicates stylistic feeling, because the reviewer attributes an affective response <i>“didn’t enjoy”</i> to a stylistic feature of the book: the epistolary form. This sentence also scores in the category of negative impact, because the reviewer expresses a negative response to that element from the book.
        </div>

        <li>negative feeling: feelings of dislike or disapproval towards any element of the book. This could mean an intense dislike for a storyline or character or a feeling of boredom or frustration with the book as a whole. Keep in mind that you may appreciate events that are in themselves afwul, such as torture, for example in thrillers. If the reviewer does so, the feeling does not count as negative.

<p>We are aware that these categories are difficult to define and can sometimes overlap. The questions we will ask you do not have right or wrong answers. Instead, we ask you to make subjective judgements, rating sentences from reviews on a five-point scale for each type of impact. When selecting your answer, please take into consideration how strongly a sentence illustrates a specific type of impact and how sure you are of your answer. If a sentence expresses impact very strongly or if you are very sure of your judgement, go to the right on the five-point scale. If a sentence doesn't express impact or if you are unsure, go to the left on the scale.</p>

        <p>You are now ready to go on to the questionnaire. Every question you answer is a great help to us. If you still have questions, go to our <em>FAQ-page.</em> </p>
