                        <h3>How does your favorite book make you feel?</h3>
                        <p>If you’re an avid reader, this question might be hard to answer. Books can make
                            us feel extatically happy or deeply sad. Books can inspire us, motivate us, or
                            make us feel like we are a part of something that matters. As long as stories
                            have existed, they have made people laugh, and they have made people cry.
                        </p>

                            In this research project, we are trying to measure the emotional impact of books
                            and stories, by analyzing the kind of emotional responses that readers express in
                            online reviews.

                    <p>
                        We currently have one open questionnaire in which we ask volunteers to help us judge
                        sentences from online book reviews on the reading impact expressed by the reviewers. If

                    <p>
                        There are millions upon millions of reviews on the internet today. Because of the
                        staggering number of online reviews available, computational analysis is the ideal
                        tool for analyzing them. But emotional impact is not easy to detect computationally.
                        That’s why we’ve created a list of words relating to features from literature
                        (aspect-terms) and a list of words relating to literature’s emotional impact
                        (impact-terms) and a set of rules formulated to measure impact in relation to
                        specific aspects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s an example:
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <table class="rule-example">
                        <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>lovely</td>
                            <td>+</td>
                            <td>character</td>
                            <td>=</td>
                            <td>narrative engagement</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>[impact-term]</td>
                            <td>+</td>
                            <td>[aspect-term]</td>
                            <td>=</td>
                            <td>type of impact</td>
                        </tr>
                        </tbody>

                    </table>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        By looking at examples from a large set of online reviews, we formulated more than
                        1300 rules of this kind, measuring different types of impact. For an explanation of
                        our categories of impact, go to the “Explanation of impact” page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can’t be sure, though, that the rules we formulated actually measure the types
                        of impact we set out to measure. That’s where you come in! Now that we have this
                        computational model for measuring impact (the impact-rules and an algorithm that
                        applies them to a large collection of online reviews), we need actual humans with
                        brains and notions of what emotional impact looks like to check our results.
                        That’s what this questionnaire is designed to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here’s another example: In 2019, researchers at the Huygens ING completed a similar
                        research project on Dutch online reviews. They found, among other things, that
                        Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince scored exceptionally high on use of the
                        word “magisch” (magical). Any human who knows Harry Potter could guess that this
                        doesn’t mean an exceptionally high number of reviewers had a magical reading
                        experience. Rather, in reference to Harry Potter, the word “magical” has little
                        to do with emotional response because the plot is actually about magic. But the
                        computer doesn’t know that! That’s why we need human validators like you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are lots of other fun and interesting things you could do if you had a clear
                        sense of the emotional impact of books. For example, this previous study into
                        Dutch reviews suggested that appreciation of a novel’s style is linked to reflection
                        on that novel. On the other hand, narrative engagement and mentions of style or
                        reflection are negatively correlated, meaning that books that are have a very
                        engaging, often suspenseful narrative are less frequently described as having an
                        affecting style or inviting reflection. Think of your favorite thriller: is this
                        true in that case?
